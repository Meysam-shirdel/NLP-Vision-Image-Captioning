## 1. Problem Statement
Image captioning in deep learning is a task that involves generating a textual description of an image. It combines techniques from computer vision and natural language processing to analyze the content of an image and produce a relevant and coherent sentence or paragraph describing it.

The primary goal of the image captioning task is to generate a coherent and accurate textual description of an image. This involves not just identifying objects in the image, but also understanding the relationships between these objects, their actions, and the context of the scene. The resulting captions should be grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.

**Main Challenges in Image Captioning**

- Object Detection and Recognition: Accurately identifying all relevant objects in an image is foundational. However, variations in object appearance, occlusion, and background clutter make this challenging.
- Contextual Understanding: Beyond recognizing individual objects, understanding the scene context and the relationships between objects (e.g., actions, spatial relationships) is crucial.

- Grammar and Syntax: Generating grammatically correct and syntactically sound sentences is essential for coherent descriptions.
- Relevance and Coherence: Ensuring that the generated captions are relevant to the image and maintain a coherent narrative throughout is challenging.
